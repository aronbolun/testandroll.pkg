In test and roll, we assume that a marketer plans to test two marketing treatments, which are labeled 1 and 2 with sample sizes of n_1 and n_2 customers. The marketer then deploys the the treatment which performs better in the test to the remaining n - n_1 - n_2 customers. "Profit-maximizing a/b tests" frame test and roll in terms of equations for profit rather than for traditional hypothesis testing. 

# Variable Names
"n" - sample sizes  
"N" - total deployment population  
"s" - the known standard deviations of the outcome   
"mu" - means of the priors on the response   
"sigma" - standard deviations of the priors on the response   
"K" - number of arms (treatments)  
"R" - number of simulation repetitions  
"n_vals" - possible sample size values  

# Functionalities
Note that some asymmetric cases have not yet been implemented

### Usage for 2-arm tests
* Compute test sizes under hypothesis testing
* Compute test sizes that maximize profit
* Compute profit under profit-maximizing tests
* Compute profit with perfect information
* Compute the error rate

### Usage for K-arm tests

Note that these require simulation
* Compute profit-maximizing test-sizes
* Compute profits for test and roll given test sizes
* Compute summary statistics for test and roll plan

### Visualizing prior effects on profits and mean response

* Graph prior densities vs. response and treatment effects
