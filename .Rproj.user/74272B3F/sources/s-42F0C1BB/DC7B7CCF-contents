## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 About Test & Roll
The Test and Roll Package implements the methods in the paper "Profit-maximizing a/b tests."  
*Source:*
Feit, E. M., & Berman, R. (2018). Profit-maximizing a/b tests. Available at SSRN.

Test & Roll (tactical A/B testing) describes an experimentation process in marketing where a subset of customers are randomly assigned to a treatment and customer response data is first collected in a "test" stage. In the "roll" stage that follows, marketers deploy one treatment to all remaining customers based on the test results.<br/>  
Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. While these tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, we re-frame them as an explicit trade-off between the opportunity cost of the test (where some customers receive a sub-optimal treatment) and the potential losses associated with deploying a sub-optimal treatment to the remainder of the population is deployed.<br/>  
Profit-maximizing Test & Roll has several advantages over traditional hypothesis testing.  
(1) The typical significance levels (alpha) in hypothesis test which aim to limit Type I errors have little consequence for profit, assuming no deployment costs. If the null is mistakenly rejected, but both treatments yield identical effects, the same profit will be earned regardless of which treatment is deployed. Because of the profit trade-off between test-stage learning and roll-stage earning, conservative sample sizes based on null hypothesis testing lower overall expected profit, by exposing too many people to the less effective treatment in the test.  
(2) The population available for testing and deploying is often limited, but the recommended sample size does not take this constraint into account. In online advertising experiments where effects are often small (but profitable), the recommended sample size may be larger than the size of the population itself. Yet when the population is limited, smaller tests that will never reach statistical significance can still have substantial benefit in improving expected profit.  With profit-maximizing test & roll, improved performance is achieved because profit-maximizing tests identify the best performing
treatment with high probability when treatment effects are large; the lost profit (regret) from errors in treatment selection is small when treatment effects are small.<br/>    
The Test & Roll package can be used to calculate test sizes as well as resulting profits under a variety of methods (hypothesis testing, profit-maximization, and Thomson Sampling). Note that the profit-maximizing test size is substantially smaller than typically recommended for a hypothesis test, particularly when the response is noisy or when the total population is small.

## 2. Usage for 2-arm tests
### 2.1 Computing profit-maximizing test sizes (2-arm tests)
**test_size_nht() computes test sizes under hypothesis testing.**
```{r}
test_size_nht(s=c(.5,.10), d=.2, conf=0.95, power=0.8, N=NULL)
```

Takes in parameters:  
"s" - vector of length 1 (symmetric) or 2 (asymmetric) indicating response standard deviation(s)  
"d" - minimum detectable difference between treatments  
"conf" - 1 - type I error rate  
"power" - 1 - type II error rate  
"N" - finite deployment population, if NULL no finite population correction is used  
and returns a vector containing the recommended sample sizes.  
<br/>
For the symmetric case $s_1=s_2=s$, the recommended sample size is calculated using $n_1 = n_2 \approx (z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 (\frac{2 s^2}{d^2})$ where $\alpha$ is 1-conf and $\beta$ is the power.
For the asymmetric case $s_1 \neq s_2$, the recommended sample sizes are calculated using $n_1=(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 (\frac{{s_1}^2+s_1s_2}{d^2})$ and $n_2=(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 (\frac{s_1s_2+{s_2}^2}{d^2})$. With finite population correction, $n_1=\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 (N) (s_1^2+s_1 s_2)}{d^2 (N-1)+(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2(s_1+s_2)^2}$ and $n_1=\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 (N) (s_1  s_2+s_2^2)}{d^2  (N-1)+(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2(s_1+s_2)^2}$
<br/>

**test_size_nn() computes the profit-maximizing test size for test & roll with 2 arms**   
```{r}
test_size_nn(N=10000, s=.1, mu=c(.7,.7), sigma=c(.05,.05))
```

Takes in parameters:  
"N" - size of deployment population  
"s" - vector of length 2 containing the standard deviations of the outcome  
"mu" - vector of length 2 containing the means of the prior on the mean response  
"sigma" vector of length 2 containing the standard deviations of the prior on the mean response  
and returns a vector containing the sample sizes.
<br/>
For the symmetric case $s_1=s_2=s$, the recommended sample size is calculated using $n_1=n_1= \frac{\sqrt{9\sigma^4 + 4 n \sigma^2 \sigma_0^2} - \frac{3}{4} \sigma^2}{4\sigma_0^2}$. For the asymmetric case, the recommended sample size is calculated using the optim() function to find the sample sizes which maximize profit_nn(). 


### 2.2 Computing profits and errors under different testing methods (2-arm tests)
**profit_nn() computes the per-customer profit for test & roll with 2 arms**
```{r}
profit_nn(n=100, N=10000, s=.1, mu=c(.7,.5), sigma=c(.2,.2))
```
Takes in parameters:  
"n" - vector of length 2 containing the sample sizes  
"N" - size of deployment population  
"s" - vector of length 2 containing the known standard deviations of the outcome  
"mu" - vector of length 2 containing the means of the prior on the mean response  
"sigma" - vector of length 2 containing the standard deviations of the prior on the mean response  
"log_n" - whether or not log(n) is an input rather than n (to avoid negative solutions), 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'  
and returns a numeric that is the per-customer profit for N customers.
<br/>
For the symmetric case, the deploy stage profit is calculated using $(N - n_1 - n_2) \left[ \mu + \frac{\sqrt{2} \sigma^2}{\sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{2\sigma^2 + \frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 n_2}s^2} }\right]$ and the test stage profit is calculated with $\mu_1(n_1+n_2)$. For the asymmetric case, the deploy stage profit is calculated using $(N-n_1-n_2) \left[\mu_1 + e\Phi\left(\frac{e}{v}\right) + v\phi\left(\frac{e}{v}\right)\right]$ where $e=(\mu_2 - \mu_1)$ and $v =  \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^4}{\sigma_1^2+s_1^2/n_1}+\frac{\sigma_2^4}{\sigma_2^2+s_2^2/n_2}}$. The test stage profit is $\mu_1n_1 + \mu_2n_2$
<br/>
**profit_perfect_nn() computes the profit with perfect information**
```{r}
profit_perfect_nn(mu=.7, sigma=.2)
```
Takes in parameters:  
"mu" - means of the prior on the mean response   
"sigma" - standard deviations of the prior on the mean response  
and returns a numeric that is the per-customer profit with perfect information  
<br/>
For the symmetric  case, the perfect information profit is calculated using $\left(\mu + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right) N$. The asymmetric case has not yet been implemented.
<br/>
**error_rate_nn() computes the rate of incorrect deployments**
```{r}
error_rate_nn(n=100, s=.5, sigma=.2)
```
Takes in parameters:  
"n" - vector of length 2 containing the sample sizes  
"s" - vector of length 1 (symmetrical) containing the standard deviations of the outcome  
"sigma" -vector of length 1 (symmetrical) containing the standard deviations of the prior on the mean response  
and returns a numeric that is the error rate  
<br/>
With symmetric normal priors, the error rate is calculated using $\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2 \pi}\arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}\sigma}{s} \sqrt{\frac{n_1 n_2}{n_1+n_2}}\right)$.
